# Framework.Demo
Java Selenium Framwork

This is a ready to use demo version of a java selenium framework. Notice that we are using POM.xml to add the ependency on the run and hence this framework is compatible with CI/CD. 
TestNG has been used for test annotations and execution. It is use as a dependency with maven again.
